## Objective
Create comfortuable environment for scientific computing using
[Julia](http://julialang.org/ "The Julia Language").

## Main Work / TODO
* Wrapper of matploblib[^why]
* Functions deal with integration, derivation, as well as eigenvalue and
eigenvector problems

[^why]: The Julia team seems to favor graphics solutions from ground up
and the standard solution has not been decided yet. I just cannot wait
that long for a mature graphics solution provided by the Julia team.
